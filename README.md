## Abstract
**Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA)** is a novel nature-inspired, swarm-based metaheuristic algorithm proposed by Abualigah *et al.* in 2022. This algorithm is modeled by mimicking the hunting behavior of crocodiles in the wild, specifically on how they scout and hunt for prey by coordinating their movements with other crocodiles. RSA has shown competitive, promising, and effective performance in solving various well-known benchmark test suites and real-world engineering optimization problems in terms of solution quality, robustness, and reliability. Moreover, the continuous p-center problem is an NP-hard optimization problem that aims to locate p number of facilities in a given space where the maximum distance between the farthest data point and its corresponding facility is minimized. Previous studies have formulated methods to optimize the continuous p-center problem using both deterministic and stochastic methods. In this study, the researcher tested the capability of RSA in solving a real-world problem, specifically, the continuous p-center problem using real-world datasets that contains household data of Davao, Digos, and Tagum City. Results generated show that RSA was not able to use any of its strategies effectively in solving the continuous p-center problem, regardless of any additional modifications made. Moreover, the results of RSA were compared with other metaheuristic algorithms, namely Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimization Algorithm, Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm, Whale Optimization Algorithm, and Stud Krill Herd Algorithm. These algorithms have also attempted to solve the continuous p-center problem using the Digos City household dataset. The analysis concludes that the RSA was not able to surpass the performance of all three metaheuristic algorithms in comparison for solving the continuous 6-center problem on the Digos City dataset.

### Researcher note: 
Several optimization/modifications may still be implemented for the code base in order to increase readability. However, the researcher has decided to focus more on the results gathering rather than the code readability.
